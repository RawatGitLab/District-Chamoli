🌍 District Chamoli - Geography for Planners & Administrators
This repository contains the source code for a live, interactive web application designed to present the geographical data of District Chamoli, Uttarakhand. The application serves as a dynamic tool for administrators, planners, and researchers.

Live Application: https://district-chamoli.onrender.com/

🗺️ Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to provide a centralized, accessible platform for visualizing and understanding the spatial geography of District Chamoli. The application is built to handle and display key geographical features, including:

Administrative boundaries

River streams and networks

Village locations

The application is currently in a live data synchronization phase, securely connecting to a MongoDB database to download and process these spatial shapefiles.

✨ Features (Current & Planned)
Live Data Stream: Connects to a MongoDB database to download the latest geographical boundaries, river streams, and village data.

Interactive Map Interface: (To be fully implemented post-data synchronization) for exploring district layers.

Targeted for Professionals: Designed specifically with the needs of district planners and administrators in mind.

🚀 Getting Started
To view the current state of the application, simply visit the live URL:
https://district-chamoli.onrender.com/

As the application is in its setup phase, you may see a status message indicating "Awaiting MongoDB Live Stream." This means the server is actively fetching and preparing the geographical data.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Hosting: Render (Backend/Application server)

Database: MongoDB (for storing and streaming spatial shapefiles)

Frontend: (To be detailed - e.g., likely a JavaScript framework/library for map rendering)

Backend: (To be detailed - e.g., Node.js, Python)

📊 Data Sources
The application synchronizes with a secure database containing the following spatial data layers for Chamoli:

Geographical Boundaries (District/Tehsil/Block levels)

River Streams (Waterway networks)

Village Locations (Settlements)

📈 Status & Roadmap
Current Phase: Data synchronization and live streaming from MongoDB.

Next Steps:

Finalize data loading for all entities.

Enable interactive map layer toggling.

Add search and query functionality for specific villages or features.

Deploy the complete interactive mapping interface.
